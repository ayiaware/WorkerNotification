## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Android Studio Arctic Fox IDE
- Minimum SDK level 21
- Manual [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Livedata](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) for asynchronous.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle - Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel - Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - DataBinding - Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
  - Room Persistence - Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
  - Navigation Component - Navigation component helps you implement navigation, ensuring a consistent and predictable user experience by adhering to an established set of [principles](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-principles)
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - DataBinding - ViewModel - Model)
